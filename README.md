# Data-Augmentation-Technique-for-Battery-Data
This is an implementation of Forecasting of Electrical parameters using Deep Neural Network Architecture(Machine Learning).

Variables considered- Voltage (V), Charge Capacity (Ah), Discharge Capacity (Ah).

Deep neural networks were used to forecast electrical parameters like Voltage, Current, State-of-Charge which helps to solve the limited data challenges. 
Tech: Python.
